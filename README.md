# Smart Hangman
This repository contains a Hangman game implementation using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. In this version of Hangman, after the player either succeeds or fails to guess the word, the computer uses a genetic algorithm to guess the given word. The genetic algorithm aims to evolve a population of potential solutions to find the correct word.
